        <div><h3>Who is the Rabbit</h3></div>
<div>The White Rabbit in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland serves as the story’s catalyst—he’s the curious, frantic figure who leads Alice into Wonderland when she follows him down the rabbit hole. Nervous, hurried, and obsessed with being late, he represents the unpredictable and often illogical nature of the world Alice is about to enter. Throughout the story, the White Rabbit pops in and out, guiding Alice indirectly and symbolizing both her curiosity and the sense of urgency that propels her deeper into her adventure.</div>
        <div><h3>Appearance</h3></div>
<div>In Disney’s 1951 Alice in Wonderland cartoon, the White Rabbit is a small, round, and tidy-looking rabbit with white fur, a pink nose, and spectacles perched on his face. He wears a red coat, yellow waistcoat, and often carries a large pocket watch, which he checks obsessively while hurrying about. His flustered expressions, quick movements, and constant worry about being late make him both charming and comically frantic.</div>
        <div><h3>Author's Note</h3></div>
        <div>Lewis Carroll never wrote a standalone explanation of the White Rabbit, but his notes and the way the character is portrayed in the book make his purpose clear. Carroll used the White Rabbit to spark curiosity and set the story in motion—he is the irresistible mystery that lures Alice into a world where logic twists and ordinary rules no longer apply. The rabbit’s anxious behavior, constant rushing, and polite yet flustered personality embody the playful absurdity Carroll loved to create. Through the White Rabbit, Carroll introduces readers to Wonderland’s whimsical tone and invites them to follow Alice into a place where the unexpected is always just around the corner.</div>

        <div><h3>Who is the Mad Hatter?</h3></div>
<div>The Mad Hatter in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is an eccentric, unpredictable character known for his nonsensical logic and chaotic behavior. He hosts the never-ending tea party where time has stopped, creating a world where normal rules and manners no longer apply. The Hatter speaks in riddles, contradicts himself, and shifts moods quickly, embodying the playful absurdity that defines Wonderland. Through his whimsical yet bewildering presence, he challenges Alice’s expectations of order and highlights the story’s theme of embracing the unexpected.</div>
        <div><h3>Appearance</h3></div>
<div>In Disney’s 1951 Alice in Wonderland cartoon, the Mad Hatter is a quirky, brightly dressed character with wild white hair and bushy eyebrows. He wears an oversized green top hat marked with the famous “10/6” price tag, a yellow coat, a green vest, and a large blue bow tie. His exaggerated facial expressions, rapid movements, and slightly disheveled look emphasize his chaotic, unpredictable nature. Altogether, his appearance perfectly matches his eccentric personality and the whimsical madness of Wonderland.</div>
        <div><h3>Author's Note</h3></div>
        <div>The Hatter’s madness comes from the Victorian phrase “mad as a hatter,” referring to real hat-makers who suffered mercury poisoning. In the story, Carroll uses the Hatter to explore the absurdity of language, time, and social conventions—especially through the chaotic tea party where time has literally stopped. The Hatter’s riddles, nonsensical conversations, and unpredictable behavior highlight Carroll’s fascination with logic turned upside down, making the character one of Wonderland’s most memorable embodiments of playful madness.</div>

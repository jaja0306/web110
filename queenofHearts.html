        <div><h3>Who is the Queen of Hearts?</h3></div>
<div>The Queen of Hearts in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is a loud, temperamental ruler known for her explosive anger and her signature command, “Off with their heads!” She embodies the chaotic, irrational authority of Wonderland, where rules change on a whim and justice is arbitrary. Despite her frightening demeanor, she is often more bluster than actual danger, as her threats are rarely carried out. Through the Queen of Hearts, Carroll playfully critiques the absurdity of unchecked power and the way it can turn even simple situations into frantic confusion.</div>
        <div><h3>Appearance</h3></div>
<div>In Disney’s 1951 Alice in Wonderland cartoon, the Queen of Hearts is portrayed as a large, imposing woman with a heart-shaped face, black hair pulled back, and a small gold crown perched on her head. She wears a dramatic red, black, and yellow gown patterned with hearts and a high white collar that adds to her commanding presence. Her expressions swing wildly from smug satisfaction to explosive fury, emphasizing her unpredictable temperament. Overall, her bold colors and exaggerated features visually reinforce her role as the loud, domineering ruler of Wonderland.</div>
        <div><h3>Author's Note</h3></div>
        <div>. In the book, Carroll portrays her as a caricature of irrational power—quick-tempered, loud, and obsessed with ordering executions at the slightest inconvenience. Through her exaggerated behavior, Carroll pokes fun at leaders who use fear instead of logic, turning minor problems into spectacles of chaos. The Queen’s bluster, combined with the fact that few of her threats are actually carried out, shows that her power is more theatrical than real, highlighting Carroll’s humorous view of overbearing rulers.</div>
